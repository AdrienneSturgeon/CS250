# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Getting user feedback is a great way to begin understanding user needs. Surveys, meetings, and focus panels can give me an idea
into what motivates an user to use my program. Once I understand what the user needs, I can begin developing features that meet
those needs. User stories can translate those inital ideas into a format that explains not just what a feature should do, but
how it should be used by the user.
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I plan to incorpate many of the Agile principles of planning when working on larger projects. I think Agile's methods of estimation help set realistic expectatinos around workloads. Things like planning poker can help me better understand the scale of a feature, and can be instrumental in setting up functional timelines.
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member requires excellent communication and coorperation. In Agile every team member takes on tasks that play to their strenghths, but that means you'll often rely on your team mates to help fill in your gaps of knowlege. Scrum meetings can be a great opportunity to reach out for help or share where you're stuck on a project. Being able to collaborate and share recources and knowlege helps helps ensure that each task is completed as efficently as possible.
